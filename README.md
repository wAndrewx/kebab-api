## Usage

### Deployment

This example is made to work with the Serverless Framework dashboard which includes advanced features like CI/CD, monitoring, metrics, etc.

```
$ serverless login
$ serverless deploy
```

To deploy without the dashboard you will need to remove `org` and `app` fields from the `serverless.yml`, and you wonâ€™t have to run `sls login` before deploying.
